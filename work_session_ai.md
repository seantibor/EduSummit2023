Work Session: Making sense of the impact of AI on teaching and learning Python

Abstract
---

The latest generation of AI tools is already having an enormous impact on the ways that people interact with code. They change the way people write code, maintain code, and learn about code. They are going to change the way people teach programming as well.

It's often said that "The invention of calculators changed the way we teach math." Unfortunately, this is not true for many students, even to this day. Many students' experience of math is severely impacted by continuing to make them do what calculators can easily do. As we all head into this new era of programming, we should aim to avoid this dynamic in how we teach Python.

This workshop is a structured small-group conversation. People will be satisfied if they come away with new, shared ways of thinking about the impacts of AI tools on teaching and learning. People will be less satisfied if they just sit through a conversation of random thoughts about AI tools.

Workshop goals and structure
---

- Recognize the impact that AI tools are already having on the ways that many people interact with code.
- Agree on a set of guiding questions about how to think about the impact of AI on teaching and learning, specifically teaching and learning Python.
- Break into groups of 4-6, based on which guiding questions are most significant to you at this point.
- Return to the whole group to share any takeaways. Focus question: "What perspective did someone else in your group share, that made you think differently or more clearly about the impact of AI on teaching and learning?"
- Encourage people to (respectfully of others) share more coherent takes in blog posts, or other appropriate formats.

Initial guiding questions
---

- Understanding current AI tools
    - What are the latest tools that people are using?
    - What are people doing with these tools?
    - How are people accessing these tools?
    - How are people interacting with these tools?
- Equity issues
    - Who has access to which tools? Who does not have access?
    - Who is making decisions about what kind of access is offered?
    - What will programming look like for people with access over the next 3 years?
    - What happens to people without access to the latest tools?
- How does this impact the way we teach programming?
    - How would the ubiquitous availability of AI tools change the importance of learning the funamentals of programming? What are the new fundamentals?
    - What are the end goals of learning to program?
    - Who actually needs to learn the fundamentals of programming if everyone can ask an AI to build custom tools with code? (ie, How much does this undermine the "everyone should learn to code" argument?)
- How does this impact the way people learn programming?
    - The internet was supposed to let anyone learn to code, but information and resource overload made that harder than it seemed. Does access to AI assistants change that?
    - How much does an AI's "memory" affect its usefulness as a teacher/ tutor/ assistant?
    - What would an effective AI "teacher" look like? What would an ineffective (or harmful) AI teacher look like?
- Cautions
    - What should people be careful about? (currently thinking about people naively dumping private corporate code into AI tools that are actively storing and analyzing all data.)
